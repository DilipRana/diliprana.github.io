                            I am currently a graduate research assistant working with Prof. Zheyu Zhang. Currently, I am honored to be involved in a <b>NASA-funded project</b> focused on evaluating the suitability of GaN HEMTs for future lunar missions. My work involves conducting stress tests that replicate lunar environmental conditions and assessing device performance to support the design of next-generation power converters. My research centers on the reliability assessment of GaN HEMTs, with a strong focus on understanding their behavior under extreme operating conditions.

                            Following a three-month internship, I joined Yatri Motorcycles—Nepal’s first and only electric two-wheeler startup—as a full-time Embedded Hardware Engineer. I was involved in the design, testing, and implementation of critical hardware components for vehicle embedded systems, including the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU), power relay boards, and more. This role required close collaboration with multidisciplinary teams for system-level testing and design validation. Seeing these developments successfully integrated into the final product was a highly rewarding experience.

Our analysis considered projected energy generation and demand trends over the next five years. To support the case for local adoption, we built a functional induction heater prototype demonstrating the potential for in-country production. Our team <b>won</b> the hackathon in the efficiency category.

                                    Gallium Nitride (GaN) HEMTs demonstrate superior performance at cryogenic temperatures, making them promising candidates for lunar missions where temperatures vary from 50 to 400 K. However, the current collapse effect increases dynamic on-state resistance (Rdson) during switching, leading to additional energy loss, especially in high-frequency applications. To conduct a comprehensive study with high efficiency, we developed an automated characterization platform for dynamic Rdson extraction under multi-stressor conditions. The design considerations include 1) programmable stressors such as temperatures, voltages, currents, etc., 2) electrothermal-mechanical compatibility with the cryocooler across a wide temperature range, and 3) software framework for full automation. Results for a commercial GaN HEMT show that dynamic Rdson varies non-monotonically with temperature increment, as it increases at 50 - 180 K and then decreases a 180 - 400 K. Dynamic Rdson follows this trend at both hard- and soft-switching, but is more sensitive to stressors at hard switching, while remaining nearly unchanged at soft switching, indicating that, under this testing plan that applies low stressing voltages, hot electron effect makes the major contribution to dynamic Rdson.

                                    <b>Objective:</b>
                                    To transfer the power upto 150W within the range of 20cm and space constrained by the base area of the scooter taken as a reference. The room of misalignment were to be provided with safety to living beings according to health standards.<br/>
                                    <b>Methodology:</b>
                                    Inductive wireless power transfer was chosen as near field high power transmission. The magnetic field standards limited the flux density around the coils, which was used to optimize the different coil designs within the mechanical constraints. Different coil shapes and dimentions were simulated in Multiphysics Simulation tool to select the optimal design for our requirement. The electronic circuit of the system was then designed and simulated with parts available to our area.<br/>
                                    <b>Results:</b>
                                    The project was presented to department with working hardware prototype. The device performance was calculated and found to meet the criteria specified. The maximum efficiency of the power transfer was achieved upto 90%.<br/>

                                    As it was 'Energy Hackathon', our objective was to perform scientific analysis of impact under the transition from LPG to induction heater in current grid system and overall economy of people and nation in Nepal and present whether it is good idea or not.<br/>
                                    <b>Methodology:</b>
                                    With latest consmer data from NEA (Nepal Electricity Authority), the consumption of electrical energy and LPG import in Nepal were forecasted with both NEA forecast and other standard forecast stats. In future, if energy from LPG was to be replaced by the induction cooker, the total energy per person and total cost per person was calculated. At the same time, the impact of this consumption in grid considering cooking time in Nepal and energy cost with peak hour load in the grid.<br/>
                                    <b>Results:</b>
                                    The result from the analysis were presented in hackathon with detailed benifits and challenges anaylsis along with steps to be taken in advance. Also, the ZVS circuit induction heater model were prepared to demonstrate the possibility of induction heater product development in Nepal. The idea was appreciated by judges with valuable feedbacks. We won under efficiency theme.<br/>
